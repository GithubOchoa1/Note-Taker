# Note-Taker
### A note-taking application to create easy access notes and saving them into the database.

- WHEN I click on the link to the notes page THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page WHEN I click on the Save icon THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column THEN that note appears in the right-hand column WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
